##PART1: Imaging technique inspiration

**Chosen artwork**
*Flowers and People – Dark* by teamlab
The interactive digital artwork continuously creates flowers that bloom and wither in response to the viewers’ presence and movements. It depend on how close the viewer stands to the artwork, the flowers may shed their petals all at once or come back to life and bloom again. I find this technique inspiring because it captures the fleeting nature of life and highlights the dynamic relationship between humans and nature. In my project, I aim to incorporate real-time generative imagery that evolves in response to user interaction. This approach can enrich the assignment by merging aesthetic beauty with responsive behavior.
