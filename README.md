##PART1: Imaging technique inspiration

**Chosen artwork**

Flowers and People – Dark by TeamLab

The interactive digital artwork continuously creates flowers that bloom and wither in response to the viewers’ presence and movements. It depend on how close the viewer stands to the artwork, the flowers may shed their petals all at once or come back to life and bloom again. I find this technique inspiring because it captures the fleeting nature of life and highlights the dynamic relationship between humans and nature. In my project, I aim to incorporate real-time generative imagery that evolves in response to user interaction. This approach can enrich the assignment by merging aesthetic beauty with responsive behavior.

##PART2: Coding technique exploration

**Coding technique**

Using a p5.js particle system can simulate the blooming and fading of flowers. Each particle’s lifecycle controls size, opacity, and color transitions. The mouse poistion from users may trigger more particles, creating a responsive environment. This approach echoes the interactive qualities of TeamLab’s Flowers and People – Dark, offering an accessible way to prototype real-time generative visuals that respond directly to viewer presence.
